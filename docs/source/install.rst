Installation
============

The easiest way to get the python bindings is if you have setuptools_ 
installed. ::

    easy_install python-amazon-product-api
    
Without setuptools, it's still pretty easy. Download the .tgz file from 
`Cheeseshop`_, untar it and run::
    
    python setup.py install

You'll also find binaries there to make your life easier if you happen to use
a Windows system.

The development version is available `bitbucket.org`_. Feel free to clone the 
repository and add your own features. ::
    
    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/basti/python-amazon-product-api/
