Amazon's Product Advertising API provides...

    [...] programmatic access to Amazon's product selection and discovery
    functionality so that developers like you can advertise Amazon products to
    monetize your website.
    
    The Product Advertising API helps you advertise Amazon products using
    product search and look up capability, product information and features
    such as Customer Reviews, Similar Products, Wish Lists and New and Used
    listings. You can make money using the Product Advertising API to advertise
    Amazon products in conjunction with the Amazon Associates program. Be sure
    to join the Amazon Associates program to earn up to 15% in referral fees
    when the users you refer to Amazon sites buy qualifying products. [#amazon]_

Features
--------

This module offers a light-weight access to the latest version of the Amazon 
Product Advertising API without getting in your way. All requests are signed
as required since August 15, 2009.

.. 
   By default the XML response is returned as a object parsed by `lxml.objectify`_. 
   However, you can substitute this with your own parsing method if you so wish.
