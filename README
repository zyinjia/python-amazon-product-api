Amazon's Product Advertising API provides programmatic access to Amazon's
product selection and discovery functionality. it has search and look up 
capabilities, provides information on products and other features such as 
Customer Reviews, Similar Products, Wish Lists and New and Used listings. 

This module offers a light-weight access to the latest version of the Amazon 
Product Advertising API without getting in your way. All requests are signed
as required since August 15, 2009.

More information about the API can be found at

Basic usage
-----------

In order to use this API you'll obviously need an Amazon Associates Web Service
account for which you must with Amazon at http://aws.amazon.com. Each account
contains an *AWSAccessKeyId* and a *SecretKey*. 

The API itself can used like this::

    AWS_KEY = '...'
    SECRET_KEY = '...'
    
    api = API(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY)
    node = api.item_search('Books', Publisher='Galileo Press')

The ``node`` object returned is a `lxml.objectified`__ element. All its content
can be accessed using the lxml.objectify API::
    
    # .pyval will convert the node content into int here
    total_results = root.Items.TotalResults.pyval
    total_pages = root.Items.TotalPages.pyval
    
    # get all books from result set and 
    # print author and title
    for book in node.Items.Item:
        print '%s: "%s"' % (book.ItemAttributes.Author, 
                            book.ItemAttributes.Title)

Please refer to the `lxml.objectify`_ documentation for more examples.
