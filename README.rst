====================================================
Python bindings for Amazon's Product Advertising API
====================================================

The Product Advertising API provides programmatic access to Amazon's
product selection and discovery functionality so that developers like you
can advertise Amazon products to monetize your website.

The Product Advertising API helps you advertise Amazon products using
product search and look up capability, product information and features
such as Customer Reviews, Similar Products, Wish Lists and New and Used
listings. You can make money using the Product Advertising API to advertise
Amazon products in conjunction with the Amazon Associates program. Be sure
to join the Amazon Associates program to earn up to 15% in referral fees
when the users you refer to Amazon sites buy qualifying products.

Basic usage
-----------

In order to use this API you'll obviously need an Amazon Associates Web Service
account for which you must with Amazon at http://aws.amazon.com. Each account
contains an *AWSAccessKeyId* and a *SecretKey*. 

The API itself can used like this::

    AWS_KEY = '...'
    SECRET_KEY = '...'
    
    api = API(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY)
    node = api.item_search('Books', Publisher='Galileo Press')

The ``node`` object returned is a `lxml.objectified`__ element. All its content
can be accessed using the lxml.objectify API::
    
    # .pyval will convert the node content into int here
    total_results = root.Items.TotalResults.pyval
    total_pages = root.Items.TotalPages.pyval
    
    # get all books from result set and 
    # print author and title
    for book in node.Items.Item:
        print '%s: "%s"' % (book.ItemAttributes.Author, 
                            book.ItemAttributes.Title)

Please refer to the `lxml.objectify`_ documentation for more examples.
